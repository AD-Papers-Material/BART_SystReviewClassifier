\section{Posterior predictive
distributions}\label{posterior-predictive-distributions}}

Figure 1 show the mixture of the PPD of the probability of a positive
match, grouped by label (only records manually labelled or reviewed are
considered). The posterior samples for each record were extracted and
joined into a global distribution; on this distribution, density was
computed on the logit scale and then logistic transformed for displaying
on a \([0 - 1]\) scale. The purple ridges show the distribution of the
still unlabelled records.\\
For each iteration, the thresholds which define the ``uncertainty
zone'', i.e, the lower and the upper range of 98\% PrI for the positive
and negative records respectively, are shown. Records whose 98\% PrI
intersects the uncertainty zone requires manual review.\\
Notice how the positive and negative record densities tend to
increasingly overlap at each iteration; meanwhile the distribution of
the records to be reviewed shrinks and shifts towards the negative side,
as positive records get found and labeled.\\
In Session 2, as the number of negative records reviewed increased, also
already positively labelled records re-entered the uncertainty zone;
this is due to the baseline positivity rate decreasing as the number of
negatives in the training data increased, forcing to review dubious
records that may have been mislabelled.

\hypertarget{list-of-terms-relevant-for-prediction}{%
\section{List of terms relevant for
prediction}\label{list-of-terms-relevant-for-prediction}}

In table 1 and 2 are listed the 50 more relevant terms used by the BART
algorithm to discriminate between positive and negative records, for
Session 1 and 2 (see Methods). Term importance (``Inclusion rate'' in
the tables) is defined as the ensemble average inclusion rate in
posterior trees over 10,000 total term inclusions, while the Inclusion
Stability (IS) is the ratio of the average inclusion rate over its
standard deviation among the ensemble models. The symbol ``\textbar{}''
in the terms indicate redundant terms while ``\&'' indicate nc-grams.
The component in which the term was used is reported in the leftmost
column.\\
For each term, we added its linear association with a positive label
estimated through a Poisson regression, reporting it as Relative Risk
(RR) and its statistical significance (Statistic) measured as number of
standard errors, s.e., of the terms. A strong BART score with a
Statistic close to zero identify terms whose effect is highly non-linear
(e.g., they are relevant only in the presence of other terms).

Table 3 shows the best hyperparameter set and their performance for each
cluster while figure 2 displays the conditional impact on performance of
each hyperparameter.

The most influential parameters were the number of models in the
ensemble, the oversampling rate and the initial training set size. The
use of bootstrap resampling seemed detrimental.

abstract: |
  The exponential growth of scientific production makes secondary literature abridgements increasingly demanding.
  We introduce a new open-source framework for systematic reviews that significantly reduces time and workload for collecting and screening scientific literature.\
  The framework provides three main tools:
  1) an automatic citation search engine and manager that collects records from multiple online sources with a unified query syntax,
  2) a Bayesian, active machine learning, citation screening tool based on iterative human-machine interaction to increase predictive accuracy and,
  3) a semi-automatic, data-driven query generator to create new search queries from existing citation data sets.\
  To evaluate the automatic screener's performance, we estimated the median posterior sensitivity and efficiency [90% Credible Intervals] using Bayesian simulation to predict the distribution of undetected potentially relevant records.\
  Tested on an example topic, the framework collected 17,755 unique records through the citation manager;
  766 records required human evaluation while the rest were excluded by the automatic classifier;
  the theoretical efficiency was 95.6% [95.3%, 95.7%] with a sensitivity of 100% [93.5%, 100%].\
  A new search query was generated from the labelled dataset, and 82,579 additional records were collected;
  only 567 records required human review after automatic screening, and six additional positive matches were found.
  The overall expected sensitivity decreased to 97.3% [73.8%, 100%] while the efficiency increased to 98.6% [98.2%, 98.7%].\
  The framework can significantly reduce the workload required to conduct large literature reviews
  by simplifying citation collection and screening while demonstrating exceptional sensitivity.
  Such a tool can improve the standardization and repeatability of systematic reviews.

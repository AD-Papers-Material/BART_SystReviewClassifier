  - section_title: Background
    section_text: |
     The exponential growth of scientific production makes secondary literature abridgements increasingly demanding.
     We introduce a new open-source framework for systematic reviews that significantly reduces time and workload for collecting and screening scientific literature.
  - section_title: Methods
    section_text: |
     The framework provides three main tools:
     1) an automatic citation search engine and manager that collects records from multiple online sources with a unified query syntax,
     2) a Bayesian, active machine learning, citation screening tool based on iterative human-machine interaction to increase predictive accuracy and,
     3) a semi-automatic, data-driven query generator to create new search queries from existing citation data sets.\
     To evaluate the automatic screener's performance, we estimated the median posterior sensitivity and efficiency [90% Credible Intervals] using Bayesian simulation to predict the distribution of undetected potentially relevant records.\
  - section_title: Results
    section_text: |
     Tested on an example topic, the framework collected 17,755 unique records through the citation manager;
     766 records required human evaluation while the rest were excluded by the automatic classifier;
     the theoretical efficiency was 95.6% [95.3%, 95.7%] with a sensitivity of 100% [93.5%, 100%].\
     A new search query was generated from the labelled dataset, and 82,579 additional records were collected;
     only 567 records required human review after automatic screening, and six additional positive matches were found.
     The overall expected sensitivity decreased to 97.3% [73.8%, 100%] while the efficiency increased to 98.6% [98.2%, 98.7%].\
  - section_title: Conclusions
    section_text: |
     The framework can significantly reduce the workload required to conduct large literature reviews
     by simplifying citation collection and screening while demonstrating exceptional sensitivity.
     Such a tool can improve the standardization and repeatability of systematic reviews.

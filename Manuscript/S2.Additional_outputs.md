# Posterior predictive distributions

Figure 1 show the mixture of the predictive distribution of the
probability of a positive match, grouped by labelling status. The
posterior samples for each record were extracted and joined in a global
distribution; on this distribution, density was computed on the logit
scale and then logistic transformed for display on a
\[0 − 1\]
scale. The light violet ridges show the distribution of the still
unlabelled records.  
For each iteration, the thresholds which define the lower and the upper
range of 98% predictive interval (PrI) respectively for the positive and
negative records. The zone comprised between these two boundaries
defines the uncertainty zone; records whose 98% PrI intersects this zone
requires manual review.  
Notice how the positive and negative densities start overlapping
starting with the second iteration of Session 2. Meanwhile the
distribution of the records to be reviewed shrink and shift towards the
negative side, as positive records get found and labeled.

# List of terms relevant for prediction

In table 1 and 2 are listed the 50 more relevant terms used by the BART
algorithm to discriminate between positive and negative records, for
Session 1 and 2. Term importance (“Value” in the tables) is defined as
the proportion over 10 000 posterior trees in which a term was used
divided by the standard deviation of this value among each model
repetition. The symbol “\|” indicate synonyms while terms joined by “&”
represent terms that are co-present in a document component The
component in which the term was used is reported in the leftmost
column.  
Next to it, we added the relative risk of a positive match (RR) and
statistical relevancy (measured as standard errors, s.e.) of the terms
estimated through a Poisson regression, to evaluate its linear
correlation with the probability of a positive match. A strong BART
score with a low regression score identify terms whose effect is highly
non linear (e.g., they are relevant only in the presence of other
terms).

# Hyperparameters grid search

To select the engine hyperparameter set which would maximize sensitivity
and efficiency, we set up a comprehensive grid search by running the
algorithm on a fully labeled dataset of 1200 records. Using a partition
tree algorithm we grouped the searches in a number of clusters with
similar performance and selected the best parameter set in the best
cluster.  
Table 3 shows the best parameter set and their performance for each
cluster while figure 2 displays the conditional impact on performance of
each parameter.

![Figure 2. Performance clusters and impact of single hyperparameters on
engine performance. The performance is measured as Sensitivity x
Efficiency. Each cluster is color coded. Mods: num. of models in the
ensemble; Quant: uncertainty zone interval to trigger manual review;
Resamp: bootstrap resampling; Init: num. of initial training records;
Multi: oversampling multiplier of positive
matches.](S2.Additional_outputs_files/figure-gfm/hyperparameters-1.png)

- barriers to implement automatic syst review Thomas J: Diffusion of innovation in systematic review methodology: why is study selection not yet assisted by automation?

- difficulty in understanding and technical implementation among general users @o2015using

- the framework corrected one wrong classification acting also a second screener @o2015using

-  Wallace et al. state that ‘class imbalance presents a problem for classification algorithms, because they have typically been optimised for accuracy, rather than the recall of a particular class’.
